- It is _Applicatoin Programming Interface_. Now, let's break them down a little bit. 
- Here, **I** means _Interface_. That means a way to interact with something. If *interactoin process* is easy to understand, then you can say you have successfully implemented an interface.
- Let say, You are watching an Youtube video in the browser, Now What does that mean? It means that there is something that is interacting with the Youtube server and getting the video and showing it to you. That something is called an **Application**. And the way it is interacting with the Youtube server is called **API**.

# when you ask most of developers why they design and build apis?
- it's because they have and applications that is implemented as multiple distributed componentes, and those components call each other's api for the complete application to function. 
- They can also say that they are implementing the api of a service that is used by multiple applications.

# what some solution characterstics they prioritize when they design and build apis?
- ease of programming for both client and server, and efficiency execution.
